# celilurk
This was a joke, but it works. Checks if the currently focused window is a Twitch stream. If yes, it gets the emote prefix and types it out for you. 
I personally run `server_celibork.py` on startup and bound `celilurk.py` to meta+n. 
I made this as a joke because [starsmitten](https://twitch.tv/starsmitten) accidentally changed her prefix from celi to celilurk, and that was a hassle to type out every time :)
